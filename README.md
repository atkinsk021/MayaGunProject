# MayaGunProject
3 LOD's of a gun model created in Maya for use in Unreal Engine, Unity etc.
This was done as a project for 3D Assets module in Entertainment System course in WIT.

Due to file size, folder must be downloaded from an external MEGA download.

3 models of the same gun but in 3 different Levels Of Detail. Folder also contains 4 rendered images of the highest LOD model.
While not the highest quality model, I was aiming for a 5th gen(PS1, NINTENDO 64), 6th gen(PS2, XBOX, GAMECUBE) and 
7th gen console(PS3, XBOX 360, WII) look between the 3 models.
Texturing was whatever I could grab from Google images and UV Map. Final result looks akin to the textures of 6th gen games.
